Generally stand-alone notebooks to implement algorithms in the context of data science / machine learning / AI:
- [Principle component analysis (PCA)](pca.ipynb): fun with Eigen-faces, Eigen-digits, and Eigen-cruves
- [Adversarial search](adversarial_search.ipynb): adversarial search notes implementation on tic-tac-toe
- [Decision trees](decision_tree.ipynb): decision tree implementation including visualisation via graphviz
